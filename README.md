After completing this activity, take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions:

How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

1.I started with basic fuction templates that were easy to work one and that helped me create my functions that i needed.

2. The hardest part about incorporating conditional logic is knowing what to do if its true or false and knwing what should be started with, for example with the age and is employed I started with age first because being under 18 is an automatic non qualifier then inside that logic the is employed is then looked at. figuring out this logic was and what should be at the top of the "logic tree" can be difficult to figure out

3. Refactoring helps figure out whats wrong and what variables in the code are being used at each time.
